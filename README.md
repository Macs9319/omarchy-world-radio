# World Radio

[![CI](https://github.com/Macs9319/omarchy-world-radio/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Macs9319/omarchy-world-radio/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Spin the globe, land somewhere you've never been, and hear what's actually playing there
right now.

World Radio is an [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) shell plugin built around that one
idea. Pick a country, a language, or just search for something nearby, narrow it down by
mood or decade if you feel like it, and tune in. It's a small nod to
[radiooooo.com](https://app.radiooooo.com/)'s "spin the globe" trick — but built entirely
on the open [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info/) directory instead of a
closed catalog, so there's no proprietary anything behind it.

## Features

- **Country picker** — flags for popular countries, plus a search box covering every
  country in the directory.
- **Search by name** — type a station name to filter the list, on its own or combined
  with any other filter you've picked.
- **Mood and decade** — tap a tag like pop, jazz, or 90s to narrow things down; use both
  together if you like.
- **Language filter** — search by language, and combine it with whatever else you've set.
- **Near me** — finds stations within 50km of roughly where you are, using your
  connection's location. No typing an address.
- **Trending and Recently added** — sort the list by what's popular right now or what's
  newest, instead of all-time popularity.
- **Shuffle** — mixes up the order of your current list without touching any filter.
  (Surprise, below, is different — it ignores your filters entirely.)
- **Tuning dial** — Previous/Next step through your list one station at a time; 🎲
  Surprise picks a totally random country and station.
- **Favorites** — star a station to keep it at the top of the list. Saved to disk, so
  it's still there next time you open the panel.
- **History** — the last 15 stations you played, newest first. Play one again and it
  just moves back to the top instead of showing up twice.
- **Vote** — give a station a thumbs up in the public directory, separate from starring
  it as your own favorite.
- **Station favicon** — each station shows its own logo, when the directory has one.
- **Playback controls** — Play/Pause, Stop, and a volume slider that goes past 100% for
  extra-loud stations (it changes color past 100% as a heads-up that things might
  distort).
- **Sleep timer** — set it to stop playing after 15, 30, or 60 minutes. Picking a new
  station or hitting Stop cancels it.
- **Auto volume leveling** — quiet stations and loud ones come out at roughly the same
  volume, so you're not riding the slider every time you switch.
- **Deep bass** — a one-tap toggle (🎧, next to the volume slider) for a bit more low
  end. Stays on across stations until you turn it back off.
- **Now playing** — shows the song or show title and genre when a station sends them,
  plus a real buffering percentage while it connects.
- **Desktop notification** — switching stations with Previous, Next, or Surprise pops up
  a notification with the new station's name, so you always know what just started.
- **More reliable** — if the station directory's server has a brief hiccup, this plugin
  automatically tries again instead of just giving up.
- **Media keys** — your keyboard's play/pause/stop buttons work automatically, and so
  does any other app that can control media playback.
- **Compact mode** — shrink the panel down to just what's playing and the basic
  controls, or expand it back out to browse. It remembers which one you had open.
- In Expand mode, filters live on the left and the station list gets the whole right
  side, each scrolling on its own.

## Requirements

- [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/), with its shell (Quickshell) plugin system — this
  comes standard.
- `mpv`, the actual player doing the playback. Grab `mpv-mpris` too
  (`omarchy pkg add mpv-mpris`) if you want your media keys to work.
- `curl`, for talking to the station directory.
- `python3` (already on Omarchy) — used to read your saved favorites and history safely.
- `notify-send` (already on Omarchy) — for the station-change notification.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Macs9319/omarchy-world-radio --enable
```

Or manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Macs9319/omarchy-world-radio ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/ronnie.worldradio
omarchy plugin enable ronnie.worldradio --section right
```

## Uninstall

```sh
omarchy plugin remove ronnie.worldradio
```

This disables the plugin and deletes `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/ronnie.worldradio`. It
doesn't touch anything outside that folder — no other config files are modified. If you
added the optional keybinding from Usage below, remove that line yourself from
`~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`.

## Usage

Click the radio icon in the bar (or bind a key, e.g. in
`~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`):

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + R", "World Radio", "omarchy-shell shell toggle ronnie.worldradio")
```

Pick a country, search by name, pick a language, or hit Near me — optionally add a mood
and/or decade, reorder the list by Trending/Recently added, or hit Shuffle to mix it up
— then click a station to play it. Right-click the bar icon to stop, middle-click to
pause/resume. Click "💤 Sleep timer" to schedule an automatic stop.

Click **Compact** in the top-right of the panel to shrink it down to just playback
controls once you've found a station; click **Expand** to bring the full browser back.

## Settings

One setting is exposed in the plugin's settings form:

- **Default volume** (0–130, default 70)

## Your data

Favorites and History are saved as plain files on your machine —
`~/.local/state/omarchy/world-radio-favorites.json` and
`.../world-radio-history.json`. Reading them back is done carefully, so a corrupted or
tampered file can't cause problems: worst case, it's just treated as if you had no
favorites yet. (Wondering why History gets its own file instead of sharing one with
Favorites? There's a short note in
[docs/adr/0001-history-separate-file.md](docs/adr/0001-history-separate-file.md).)

<details>
<summary>The technical version</summary>

Reading either file goes through a small Python helper (bundled in `Panel.qml`, not a
separate file) that opens it with `O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK` and validates the result on
the same file descriptor before reading a single byte:

- **`O_NOFOLLOW`** refuses to open if the path is a symlink, instead of transparently
  reading whatever it points to.
- **`O_NONBLOCK`** makes opening a FIFO return immediately instead of blocking forever
  waiting for a writer.
- Only a plain regular file, checked via `fstat()` on the already-open descriptor (never
  a second lookup of the path), is read — and only up to a 1 MiB cap, enforced by the
  read itself rather than trimmed afterward.

This closes both a TOCTOU window (checking and reading must be the same open, not two
lookups of a path that could change in between) and a symlink-following gap, so a
hostile or corrupted replacement at that path — a FIFO, an oversized file, or a symlink
elsewhere — can't hang or bloat the shell process. Favorite count (500), History count
(15), and per-field string lengths are also capped on both load and write.

## Notes

Every station here comes from the community-run [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info/)
directory — thousands of people around the world keeping their local stream listed so
strangers can find it. This plugin has no affiliation with radiooooo.com; it just liked
the spin-the-globe idea and built its own version of it.
